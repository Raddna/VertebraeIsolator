# VertebraeIsolator

A small program made as the project in the course "CM2006 Medical Imaging Visualization" at KTH. Created by myself and another student.
Our program isolates choosen vertebrae from a preloaded spine (DICOM). The isolated vertebrae can then be manipulated with some simple tools, such as colour selection or plane cutting.

# What I have learned
- How to realize and set up a visual pipeline.
- Using Qt Designer to create a UI framework, futher implementing it in code with python using PyQt5.
- Using the VTK package, implementing different widgets.
